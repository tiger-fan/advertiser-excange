<p>
	As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using

		If you are a SkuRun Customer, when you register with us through the Site to create and manage Applications, we will ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your name, company name, email address, billing address, and credit card information. We use such personally identifiable information (in some cases, in conjunction with your non-identifying information, such as your zip	code) mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, administer your inquiries, and contact SkuRun Customers regarding account activities, new	version and product offerings, or other communications relevant to the Services.
	</li>
	<li>
		In addition, we may collect information related to interactions of End Users with your Applications as described in part (B) below.
	</li>
	<li>
		We do not sell any personally identifiable information of SkuRun Customers to any third parties. The instances where we may share such information with third parties are described in part (D) below.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may review and update the personally identifiable information in your registration profile by logging in and editing such information in your dashboard.

	</li>
	<li>

In addition, if you have an account with Facebook, Twitter, or Foursquare or other similar websites (each a “Social Network”), your Social Network identity, including your public picture, may be associated with your location data.

YOU MAY AT ANY TIME TURN OFF THIS FUNCTIONALITY BY USING THE IN-APP PRIVACY SETTINGS.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may allow other End Users to send you personal messages, in which case we may send you alerts when you get a new message. YOU MAY AT ANY TIME TURN OFF THIS FUNCTIONALITY BY USING THE IN-APP PRIVACY SETTINGS.

	<li>
		We may also collect your IP addresses as well as non-identifying details such as the geographic location of the IP address you are using to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many web pages have been viewed by you, which applications you have used, search terms used, referring/exit pages, platform type and date/time information.
	</li>
	<li>
		We do not sell any personally identifiable information of End Users to any third parties. The instances where we may share such information with third parties are described in part (D) below.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may be asked by SkuRun Customers to provide additional information to them, including your personally identifiable information, to be used and shared pursuant to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read such privacy policies before providing any information to any SkuRun Customers or other third parties.

<p class="subtitle">(D) General</p>
<p>The following provisions apply to everybody (SkuRun Customers, End Users and
Visitors).</p>

<p class="heading1">Sharing</p>
<p>We may share and/or disclose information that we collect from SkuRun Customers, End Users and Visitors in the following instances:</p>

<p><i><u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</u></i> We
may share aggregated information that does not include personally identifiable
information and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log
Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other
purposes.</p>

<p><i><u>Service Providers.</u></i> We may employ third party
companies and individuals to facilitate our Site and Services, to provide the
Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without
limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and
improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site
and Services are used. These third parties have access to information that we
collect from SkuRun Customers, End Users and Visitors only to perform these
tasks on our behalf.</p>

<p><i><u>Business Transfers.</u></i>&nbsp;SkuRun may sell, transfer
or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including personally identifiable
information collected from SkuRun Customers, End Users and Visitors, in
connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in
the event of bankruptcy.</p>

<p><i><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u></i>&nbsp;SkuRun
cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to
enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information collected
from SkuRun Customers, End Users and Visitors to government or law enforcement
officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not
limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of SkuRun or a third
party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop
activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal,
unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<p><b>Security.</b>&nbsp;SkuRun is very concerned with
safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and
electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized
access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the
security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically
stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security
breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in
the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as
consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any
measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the
reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

<p><b>International Transfer.</b> Your information may be
transferred to &#8212; and maintained on &#8212; computers located outside of your state,
province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may
not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside
the United States and choose to provide information to us, SkuRun transfers
personally identifiable information to the United States and processes it
there. Whether you are a SkuRun Customer, an End-User or a Visitor, your
consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information
represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<p><b>Links to Other Sites.</b> Our Site contains links
to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a
banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link,
you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a
website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an
endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third
party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security
policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites.
These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites
follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal
information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies
or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

<p><b>Our Policy Toward Children.</b>This Site or Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally
identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us
at <a href="mailto:info@SkuRun.com">info@SkuRun.com</a>. If we
become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable
information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>
